# NNMineSweeper
Convolutional Neural Network, Predict Position of Bomb on a mineSweeper Board with a 80% accuracy 
Requirement to get it working:
- A Python 3.5 environment with TensorFlow and Keras Working properly
- Input Data-type are 10 matrix n * m each represent the board:
  - the first is 0 when when visible and 1 when hidden
  - the second is 1 when the case is marked with a zero else 0 
  - the third is 1 when the case is marked with a one else 0  
  - etc.. for all the possible valor
- Output Data are 1 matrix whit 1 if the case is a bomb else 0
